## Overview

Over Da Rainbow is a web application for University of Hawaii students to get together and explore beautiful sceneries and destinations offered here.

* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for Javascript-based implementation of client and server code.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) for component-based UI implementation and routing.
* [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) CSS Framework for UI design.
* [Uniforms](https://uniforms.tools/) for React and Semantic UI-based form design and display.

It also provides code that implements a variety of useful design concepts, including:

* Three primary collections (Profiles, Projects, Interests) as well as three "join" Collections (ProfilesInterests, ProfilesProjects, and ProjectsInterests) that implement many-to-many relationships between them.
* Top-level index pages (Profiles, Interests, and Projects) that show how to manipulate these six collections in various ways.
* Initialization code to define default Profiles, Interests, and Projects and relations between them.
* A simple Filter page to illustrate how to perform simple queries on the database and display the results.
* Use of Meteor Methods to illustrate how to simplify implementation of multiple collection updates.
* Use of indexes to enforce uniqueness of certain fields in the collections, enabling them to serve as primary keys.
* Authentication using the built-in Meteor accounts package along with Sign Up and Sign In pages.
* Authorization examples: certain pages are public (Profiles, Projects, Interests), while other pages require login (AddProject, Filter).
* Use of Meteor Assets to initialize the database (helpful when initialization exceeds settings file size limits).
